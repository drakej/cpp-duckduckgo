The DuckDuckGo C++ API
======================

Notes
-----

- This API requires the C library libjson. You can install it on Ubuntu or Mint with "sudo apt-get install libjson0-dev"
- You will also need the buildtools that are available on unix based systems. This includes make, gcc, C++ Std Library, etc. 
- This project was built in eclipse so it's recommended that you utilize this IDE since it will be easier to integrate.

Usage
-----

Utilizing this library requires including the source files and headers within your application. It's namespaced DuckDuckGo so
you might want to utilize "using namespace DuckDuckGo" if you want to make things a bit easier, of course make sure there are no
collisions with other libraries that you are using.
